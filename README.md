# Text File Zipper Web App

- Uses Huffman Coding for Text Compression
- Made with JAVASCRIPT, HTML and CSS

## About

- Performs Lossless compression and decompression of .txt files using Huffman Coding technique.
- Each character is assigned a unique variable length binary code, instead of its 8-bit representation, with more frequent characters having smaller codes. A Huffman Tree is created and stored to generate and decode these codes.
- Compression ratio usually improves as the file size increases.
- The website is made responsive (with HTML and CSS ) and interactive (with JavaScript).
- An Info page is added to give more information about Huffman coding.
